    "text": "Hepatotox Catalog\n\nThe catalog is a series of outputs for a Stage 1 Hepatotoxicity white paper considering a set of aggregate analyses and displays to rule out potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The catalog was generated using TERN and random.cdisc.data packages.\nThis repository provides a collection of hepatotoxicity-related analyses and outputs generated using the R language. The target audience is the clinical trials community, including statisticians, data scientists, and other professionals interested in applying R to clinical trials data.\n\nWhite Paper\nThe analyses and displays in this catalog were based on the recommendations in a white paper developed by the PHUSE Safety Analytics working group. The white paper is titled:\n“Recommendations for Analyses and Displays Associated with Hepatotoxicity with a Focus on Phase 2–4 Clinical Trials and Integrated Submission Documents. Stage 1: Initial Assessment and Screening for Potential of Hepatotoxicity.”\nView PDF\n\n\nShiny App Demo\nThe following is an output comparing maximum total bilirubin vs. maximum other liver enzymes (ALT, AST, or ALP).\nInteract with the Shiny App directly below:\n\n\nUsage Setup and pre-processing of synthetic data.\nThe output generated by the given code.\nAn interactive application that can alternatively be used to produce and interact with the graph. Interacting with Catalog R Code The full source code of each article can be viewed by viewing the on the “Source Code” code block at the top of the page and copied using the “Copy” button.\nIndividual code chunks from within the article can also be viewed and copied.
