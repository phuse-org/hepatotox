# **Hepatotox Catalog**

![](images/hepatotox-hex.png){width="126"}

The catalog is a series of outputs for a Stage 1 Hepatotoxicity white paper considering a set of aggregate analyses and displays to rule out potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI). The catalog was generated using TERN and random.cdisc.data packages.

This repository provides a collection of hepatotoxicity-related analyses and outputs generated using the R language. The target audience is the clinical trials community, including statisticians, data scientists, and other professionals interested in applying R to clinical trials data.

### **White Paper**

The analyses and displays in this catalog were based on the recommendations in a white paper developed by the PHUSE Safety Analytics working group. The white paper is titled:

"Recommendations for Analyses and Displays Associated with Hepatotoxicity with a Focus on Phase 2–4 Clinical Trials and Integrated Submission Documents. Stage 1: Initial Assessment and Screening for Potential of Hepatotoxicity."
