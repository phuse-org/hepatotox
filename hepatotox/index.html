  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>Each TLG is represented on a separate article page, typically including the following sections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Setup and pre-processing of synthetic data.</li>
    <li>Steps to produce the TLG.</li>
    <li>The output TLG generated by the given code.</li>
    <li>An interactive application to produce and interact with the TLG.</li>
    <li>Reproducibility information.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Interacting with Catalog R Code</h2>
  <p>
    The full source code of each article can be viewed by clicking on the “Source Code” button at the top of the page and copied using the “Copy to Clipboard” button.
  </p>
  <p>
    Individual code chunks can also be viewed and copied. The Reproducibility tab contains session information and allows one to install the packages required to properly run the code.
